<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Car rental management system is a web-based car rental management application with booking scheduling functionality.
  A good way to find out a car near the user. In this system user can register and get logged onto the website.
  They can select the nearby available car,
  and also can check for the services. In this car booking system users have the flexibility to book the cars on their desired time and date.
  Online car booking system reduces the time wasting of the user & there hassles. This helps user to find desired car easily & quickly.
  User has to login to book a car. The user can search for cars easily and book. For bookings, the user has to provide information such as booking dates and text message.
  All car details are provided and it also includes car’s feature and overview.
  The user can also post their testimonials and the user can update their profile as well as passwords anytime they want from the site.
  Admin can add/manage car brands, manage vehicles, bookings, testimonial, pages and many more. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.
  This site makes customers easy for car rental. The design is pretty simple and the user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.</p>
<p><strong>Project objective</strong></p>
<p>My main objective is to make platform to communicate directly with the customer so that they can get their desired cars.
 Customer can get their service onto their suitable time.
  Admin will make money in two ways. Admin can give his own car for rent or customers car for 10-15% charge.
<p><strong>Alternate Approach</strong></p>
<p>There are some concerns about PHP.
  PHP is slow – I’m speaking about area of data processing and implementation of algorithms.
  Security is also a concern. Access to files that belong to other customers, viewing passwords from other customers.
  There are limitations to hosting environment – If the website is properly working fail or cause the whole system to shut down because of high CPU,
  disk, or memory requirements. This is why I came up with an alternate solution. <p>

<p><strong>System features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Login/register can be done using mail and password</li>
<li>User profile will be saved on database</li>
<li>Easy signup process- this will verified by the admin panel</li>
<li>Car profile with work details</li>
<li>Cars can be searched by names</li>
<li>Easy car booking system with a pre-book option from websites calendar</li>
<li>Live helpline service through call</li>
<li>There will be a subscribe option so that subscribers can get the get latest news</li>
<li>Admin can create/manage Brands</li>
<li>Customers can post review</li>
<li>Post/manage Vehicle option will be available for customers</li>
<li>Manage bookings, testimonials, contact queries, pages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brief overview of the technology</strong></p>

<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create and save web document. E.g. Notepad/Notepad++. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) create attractive Layout</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a technology that allows software developers to create dynamically generated web pages,
  in HTML, XML, or other document types, as per client request. PHP is open source software.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>MySql, is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating, and managing data in databases.</p>

<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<p>As the website is targeting the car drivers and owners, I will try to reach to the business owners for fund.
  Companies can also place ads on the car rental website charging 200 BDT per day.
  We will provide an advertisement package for such companies. Making payments for any users will be easy and secured.</p>

  <p><strong>Advantage</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>User can cook cars easily</li>
  <li>User’s don’t need to wait for the long time</li>
  <li>Communication will be easier between User & admin</li>
  <li>Home service will save user’s time</li>
  <li>Various service can be viewed</li>
  <li>Color blind customers can also use</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Disadvantage</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>This website requires active internet connection</li>
  <li>User’s need to put their data correctly</li>
 </ul>
<p><strong>Rough estimation of cost</strong></p>
<p>The rough estimate of cost is nearly zero because our project is web based.
  We need internet connection and appropriate setup like laptop or desktop to install the required software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future scope</strong></p>
<p>In future I want to add online payment method. If I can make sufficient enough of money from the website,
   I will work on the frontend for better looking for the customers which will attract more customers. </p>
