<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>Car rental management system is designed so as to be used by people from all classes. It is an
online system through which customers can view available cars, register, view profile and book
car. In this system user can register and get logged onto the website. They can select the
nearby available car, and also can check for the services. In this car booking system users have
the flexibility to book the cars on their desired time and date. Online car booking system reduces
the time wasting of the user & their hassles. This helps user to find desired car easily & quickly.
User has to login to book a car. The user can search for cars easily and book. For bookings, the
user has to provide information such as booking dates and text message. All car details are
provided and it also includes car’s feature and overview. The user can also post their
testimonials and the user can update their profile as well as passwords anytime they want from
the site. Admin can add/manage car brands, manage vehicles, bookings, testimonial, pages and
many more. The advancement in Information Technology and internet penetration has greatly
enhanced various business processes and communication between people. </p>

<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
<p>A car rental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period.
Getting a rental car helps people get around despite the fact they do not have access to
their own personal vehicle or don't own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car
must contact a rental car company and contract out for a vehicle. This system increases
customer retention and simplify vehicle and staff management.
  
<p><strong>Aims & Objective:</strong></p>
<p>To produce a web-based system that allow customer to register and reserve car online and for
the company to effectively manage their car rental business. To ease customer’s task whenever
they need to rent a car. My main objective is to make platform to communicate directly with the
customer so that they can get their desired cars and service onto their suitable time.<p>
  
 <p><strong>Scope:</strong></p>
 <p>This project traverses a lot of areas ranging from business concept to computing field,
and required to perform several researches to be able to achieve the project objectives.
The area covers include: Car rental industry: This includes study on how the car rental
business is being done, process involved and opportunity that exist for improvement. PHP
Technology used for the development of the application. General customers as well as the
company’s staff will be able to use the system effectively. Web-platform means that the
system will be available for access 24/7 except when there is a temporary server issue
which is expected to be minimal.<p>

<p><strong>This Car Rental System is developed to provide the following services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customer’s registration: The system should allow new users to register online.</li>
<li>Online reservation of cars: Customers should be able to use the system to make
booking and online reservation.</li>
<li> Automatic update to database once reservation is made or new customer registered:
Whenever there’s new reservation or new registration, the system should be able update
the database without any additional efforts from the admin.</li>
<li>Feedbacks to customers: It should provide means for customers to leave feedback.</li>
<li>Car search: Cars can be searched by names by registered users.</li>
<li>Easy car booking system with a pre-book option from websites calendar</li>
<li>Service: Live helpline service through call directly from website.</li>
<li>Latest news for users: There will be a subscribe option so that subscribers can get the
latest news.</li>
<li>Managing posts: Admin can create/manage car brands and edit any posts.</li>
<li>Review: Customers can post review on this website.</li>
<li>Post/manage Vehicle: This option will be available for all registered customers where
they can update their posts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brief overview of the technology:</strong></p>

<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>HTML is used to create and save web document. Notepad/Notepad++. CSS (Cascading Style
Sheets) create attractive Layout.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a technology that allows software developers to create
dynamically generated web pages, in HTML, XML, or other document types, as per client
request.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>MySql, is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating, and managing data in
databases.</p>

<p><strong>Estimation of cost:</strong></p>
<p>The initial cost of setting up the system will include the cost of hardware (server/clients, network
adapter and related hardware), software (server OS, add-on software, utilities) & labor (setup &
maintenance). Besides, the initial cost the long term cost will include the running cost for the
system including cost for human resources, cost for update/renewal of various related software.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong></p>
<p>Technical feasibility is concerned with the availability of hardware and software required for the
development of the system, to see compatibility and maturity of the technology proposed to be
used and to see the availability of the required technical manpower to develop the system. After
the study I came to conclusion that I proceed further with the tools and development
environment chosen by us. This was important in my case I was working on two various phases
of the department that will need to be integrated in future to make an extended system.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>As it is going to be used by many people in this country, the system should have a good
performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The proposed system should be accurate and fast
enough to handle huge data. It should provide fast communication between server and clients.<p>

<p><strong>Safety Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>As the system is going to handle records for a long run eliminating the manual system, it is
supposed to ensure the retaining of data avoiding or eliminating any probable cause for data
loss.<p>

<p><strong>Security Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The software should not allow unauthorized access to any module of the system. Besides, it
should maintain the privileges granted to users at various user levels.<p>

<p><strong>Security Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Car rental business has emerged with a new goodies compared to the past experience where
every activity concerning car rental business is limited to a physical location only. Even though
the physical location has not been totally eradicated; the nature of functions and how these
functions are achieved has been reshaped by the power of internet. Nowadays, customers can
reserve cars online, rent car online, and have the car brought to their door step once the
customer is a registered member or got the office to pick the car. The web based car rental
system has offered an advantage to both customers as well as Car Rental Company to
efficiency and effectively manage the business and satisfies customers need at the click of a
button.<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future scope</strong></p>
<p>In future I want to add online payment method. If I can make sufficient enough of money from the website,
   I will work on the frontend for better looking for the customers which will attract more customers. </p>
